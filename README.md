# Hand Recognition System using Keras TensorFlow 🚀💙

## Overview

This repository contains code for a hand recognition system developed as part of an internship project at Prodigy Info Tech. The system utilizes deep learning techniques implemented with Keras and TensorFlow to classify hand images into 10 different labels.

## Requirements 🎶

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib



## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset:
    - Ensure that your dataset is organized with images labeled into 10 categories.
    - You can augment your dataset if necessary for better model performance.





## Model Architecture ✌️

Describe the architecture of your neural network model here, including details such as layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms used.

## Results

Discuss the performance of your model, including accuracy, loss, and any other relevant metrics. You may also include visualizations of training/validation curves or confusion matrices.
